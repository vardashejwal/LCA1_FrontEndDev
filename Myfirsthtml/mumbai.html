The city provides lots of opportunities and is welcoming to all people from different parts. However, there are many interesting facts about the charming city that you need to know.Mumbai was earlier called as Bombay. The city was ruled by the Portuguese back in the day. During that time, they saw the city as a natural water bay and hence started to refer to the place as – Bom Bhaia which in Portuguese means “good bay”. In the year 1995, the ruling party of Shiv Sena changed the name to Mumbai to glorify the Maratha culture.Initially, Mumbai was made up of 7 different islands – Colaba, Mazagaon, Little Colaba, Parel, Mahim, Isle of Bombay, and Worli. However, between the years of 1784 and 1845, British engineers brought all these 7 islands together and thereby unified it to be one large landmass.Asia’s largest slum is located in an area called Dharavi in Mumbai. These are small homes where people from low-income areas live. However, this place is so fascinating to many that they have many tours and day excursions for people to see and witness how they all live together in harmony.The dabbawallas are Mumbai’s pride. If you get on any local station, you can find these Dabbawallas waiting to make their delivery. Started by Mahadeo Havaji Bachche in the year 1890, it was formed in order to provide, homemade meals to people who were going to offices.
